* Lambda & GrapQL Workflows

This repository is just a playground for experimenting with different ways of working with the following tools: 

- AWS Lambdas (Python)
- A GraphQL API
- Emacs org-bable and literate programming

The ultimate aim is to use the knowledge to build a serverless API using Lambdas, a suitable AWS database, and related tools.

However, this repo will not host the final solution, but rather just document some of the learning.
